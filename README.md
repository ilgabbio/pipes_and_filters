# Pipes and Filters, meetup material

This repo contains a list of different software architectures integrating OpenCV algorithms.
The toy target is an application capturing images from a camera, detecting faces, eyes and landmarks.

The target of this repo is to show some ways to design the application architecture.
Some frameworks are used for convenience, the target is not describing the frameworks but the architectures.
A presentation is accessible in the docs.

NOTE: The same application can be designed in many more ways.
I selected a path from the unstructured to some coding styles, mainly pipes and filters.
Obviously this list is not complete.

I found interesting the following links, many thanks to the authors.
